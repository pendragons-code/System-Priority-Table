# Progress?
As you know im working on getting slash commands, buttons and more working on the discord bots!         
I will be redoing all the bots and move them to slash commands!     
That said I will also still be working on other random projects!        
I have to also mention this, progress will be very slow, because I have to change more than 30 bots to slash commands, I have already done about 20 + bots as of now. That said I hope I can complete everything this DEC.

# System-Priority-Table
Things of higher priority are on top, this is my development table. This does not include the multi-headed dick hydra that is my social life and the issues that haunt my on a consistent and clockwork-like basis.


| High                        |
| --------------------------- |
|       Other projects (custom bots)               |
| Jasbot                      |
| LISBDIEV8                   |
| LISBDIEV8-GUI               |
| GALAHAD                     |
| YTDL-WEBSERVER              |

Note: LISBDIEV8 GUI can only come in after the TUI/CLI variant is done. I also intend for it to be cross platform.
