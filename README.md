# WHY THE TRUCK NOW????
So I got sick recently and I basically cannot do too much. But here are things I will still work on. Also I am suddenly put into a situation where I cannot host Jasbot and some other stuff locally for some time due to my ISP having maintainence come by soon!

# System-Priority-Table
Things of higher priority are on top, this is my development table. This does not include the multi-headed dick hydra that is my social life and the issues that haunt my on a consistent and clockwork-like basis.


| High                        |
| --------------------------- |
| Alternative host for JASBOT |
| Jasbot                      |
| LISBDIEV8                   |
| LISBDIEV8-GUI               |


Note: LISBDIEV8 GUI can only come in after the TUI/CLI variant is done. I also intend for it to be cross platform.
