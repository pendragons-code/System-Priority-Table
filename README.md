# Progress?
FUUUUUUUCK I broke my phone. I left it on a dining table and all my stuff is gone because my phone got wet.     
A lot of shit is going on for me and exam results will be back soon.
While I have not been making a lot of commits, I can guarentee you that I am working on Jasbot and LISBDIE right now. I'm just not pushing them because I never got the time to push it or there are so many things going on. Plus I actually finished GUI for LISBDIEV7 only to realize the lag it created on non-*nix based machines. So I also have to work on that. That said, I'm also getitng pretty busy again. I'm not that smart and if anything im a pretty dumb kid. Therefor i'm pretty sure my national exam results will be pretty bad, I'm pretty bad with language-orienteered subjects because I have a really hard time expressing ideas into words with syntax that makes sense and often times come up with verbose statements impractical of just filled with grammatical errors aplenty. So yeah, that said, I should be commiting to `less-terrible` and `V8` soon.

# Fatebot saga
I was asked to make a discord bot for a small fate-fanbase server. It seems that people liked it so I thought I would share it around.

# System-Priority-Table
Things of higher priority are on top, this is my development table. This does not include the multi-headed dick hydra that is my social life and the issues that haunt my on a consistent and clockwork-like basis.


| High                        |
| --------------------------- |
| Jasbot                      |
| LISBDIEV8                   |
| LISBDIEV8-GUI               |
| GALAHAD                     |
| YTDL-WEBSERVER              |

Note: LISBDIEV8 GUI can only come in after the TUI/CLI variant is done. I also intend for it to be cross platform.
