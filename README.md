# Progress?
So some shit went down... and guess what? I have made most of the other stuff work and now i can truly concentrate on the things I promised.

# System-Priority-Table
Things of higher priority are on top, this is my development table. This does not include the multi-headed dick hydra that is my social life and the issues that haunt my on a consistent and clockwork-like basis.


| High                        |
| --------------------------- |
| Jasbot                      |
| LISBDIEV8                   |
| LISBDIEV8-GUI               |
| GALAHAD                     |
| YTDL-WEBSERVER              |

Note: LISBDIEV8 GUI can only come in after the TUI/CLI variant is done. I also intend for it to be cross platform.
